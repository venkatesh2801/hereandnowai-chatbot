About HERE AND NOW AI
HERE AND NOW AI is India’s leading autonomous Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, dedicated to transforming the way AI is taught, researched, and applied. It is a brainchild of Deepti Balagopal and Ruthran Raghavan, who envisioned a future where AI education is not limited to coders but accessible to every learner — whether they’re from engineering, business, science, or the arts.
Born from the success of HERE AND NOW – The Language Institute (est. 2011), which redefined language learning in India, HERE AND NOW AI was founded in 2018 with a mission to disrupt traditional education through AI innovation. Our core initiatives lie in:
